              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                I'm <strong>Gad ISHIMWE</strong>, a full-stack developer from Rwanda with{" "}
                <strong>3 years of experience</strong> crafting digital solutions that matter. 
                As the founder of <strong>ViraX</strong>, I focus on building responsive, 
                user-friendly web applications that solve real problems and bring ideas to life.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Over the past 3 years, I've specialized in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) 
                and MySQL, with extensive experience in tools like WordPress, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, and 
                emerging technologies like AI integration and blockchain. From backend APIs to front-end design, 
                I enjoy building systems that are both powerful and easy to use.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Throughout my 3-year journey, I've successfully delivered projects like car rental platforms, 
                school and church websites, investment systems, and modern news portals. Each line of code I 
                write is aimed at delivering impact, performance, and real-world value.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground font-semibold">
                <strong>Always learning, always building</strong> â€” I'm committed to pushing boundaries 
                and growing as a developer every day.
